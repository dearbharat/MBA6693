In this course we follow step by step process of data analytics including data extraction, transformation, analyzing and drawing inferences for business decisions. We will use MySQL for data extraction and preprocessing. We will analyze data using R to apply multivariate statistical learning techniques like Clustering, PCA, ARM and Logit models while also familiarising ourselves with version control using Git, interactive JuPyteR notebooks and RStudio. We will also learn advanced algorithms like Random Forest, kNN and SVM using R. Prerequisites MBA 6606 and MBA 6607 or ADM 2623/ADM 2624 and ADM 3628. Prior experience in statistics, optimization, databases and possibly some programming is highly desirable. Start learning GitHub on your own.

The objective of this course is to expose students to challenges and tools required in data acquisition from databases, preprocess and transform the data, apply relevant methods for drawing insights and convert the output into meaningful reports and visualizations for decision making. The purpose of data analytics will be to provide better consumer, market and operations insights for enhancing business value and automating business decisions. Course Tools This class is supported by DataCamp, the most intuitive learning platform for data science. Learn R, Python and SQL the way you learn best through a combination of short expert videos and hands-on-the-keyboard exercises. Take over 100+ courses by expert instructors on topics such as importing data, data visualization or machine learning and learn faster through immediate and personalised feedback on every exercise. You will have access to the entire DataCamp course library for free for the duration of this course. I’ll make an announcement in Piazza detailing the effective dates. Piazza will be used for announcements, discussion, etc. R is the analytics tool we will be using. RStudio is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and the way you will be accessing R. RPubs is where we will be publishing our assignments and project. Preclass checklist By the end of first day of class, you are expected to: Sign up for Piazza. Make sure your name accurately reflects what is in UNB system. Accept the invite to DataCamp I emailed to you. I’ll be sending them to your maine.edu accounts the week before classes start and again on the first day of classes. DataCamp is free for the entire semester. Install R and RStudio on your computer.

Grade Determination Table 0.2: Grade Conversion. Marks Grade Marks Grade Marks Grade 89.51 - 100 A+ 84.51 - 89.5 A 79.51 - 84.5 A- 74.51 - 79.5 B+ 69.51 - 74.5 B 64.51 - 69.5 B- 59.51 - 64.5 C+ 54.51 - 59.5 C 49.51 - 54.5 D 0 - 49.5 F Course Guidelines There will be some practice sets released from time to time, which you can submit for feedback, but those will not be graded. However, the questions in assignments will be similar to the assignments. Therefore finishing these assignments independently will not only be very helpful in preparing for all examinations, but also enhance your understanding of the materials. Each quiz will be of twenty (30) minutes duration starting from the beginning of each designated class. There is no final examination but the two term tests will be cover all the material taught until the day of examination. All exams and quizzes are closed books and notes. A formula sheet, exactly the same as the one at the end of this course outline, will be provided by the instructor for all examinations. No self-prepared formula sheet is allowed. The exams may be conducted online in class or through a 24 - 48 hours take home submissions. Students who miss quizzes for whatever reasons will have the weights of the missed quizzes carried on to the term examinations. Questions and problems in all exams will be based on material discussed in the class. It is your responsibility to attend class regularly to get all the information related to the course throughout this term. Please note that attendance is expected and a student is unlikely to complete the course with success if absent. Candidates will turn off cell phones, pagers, blackberries, or other electronic devices for the duration of the class. A special request for rewriting examination may be considered only for term tests but the latest performance will be considered as final performance. So a retake may increase or decrease the marks obtained. Academic Integrity The University of New Brunswick places a high value on academic integrity and has a policy on plagiarism, cheating and other academic offences. Plagiarism includes: 1) quoting verbatim or almost verbatim from any source, including all electronic sources, without acknowledgement; 2) adopting someone else’s line of thought, argument, arrangement, or supporting evidence without acknowledgement; 3) submitting someone else’s work, in whatever form, without acknowledgement; and 4) knowingly representing as one’s own work any idea of another. Examples of other academic offences include: 1) cheating on exams, tests, assignments or reports; 2) impersonating somebody at a test or exam; 3) obtaining an exam, test or other course materials through theft, collusion, purchase or other improper manner; 4) submitting course work that is identical or substantially similar to work that has been submitted for another course; and 5) more, as set out in the academic regulations found in the Undergraduate Calendar (https://eservices.unb.ca/calendar/undergraduate/). Penalties for plagiarism and other academic offences range from a minimum of F (zero) in the assignment, exam or test to a maximum of suspension or expulsion from the University, plus a notation of the academic offence on the student’s transcript. For more information, please see the Undergraduate Calendar, Section B, Regulation VIII.A (https://eservices.unb.ca/calendar/undergraduate/display.cgi?tables=regulationsSubLevel1&amp;id=43) or visit: http://nocheating.unb.ca. It is the student’s responsibility to know the Regulations. Bharat Bhushan Verma Instructor I strongly urge you to post your academic queries on Piazza. If you are shy and do not want to reveal your identity while posting your query, you can post anonymously. Similarly, I strongly urge you to answer the question posted by other students so that you can test your own understanding. While doing so you can earn the bonus 5% extra credits. It can make a difference to your getting your scholarship or not. Take full advantage of the Piazza platform to maximize your score. I am restricting myself to answer posted queries for eight hours to give enough room for other students to reply to the query. I won’t be answering any queries related to the course sent to my email. I will only respond to queries posted on Piazza only. You can contact me through email on bharat.verma@unb.ca for anything that is specific to you or only few of you. You are welcome to meet me in my office 321, Tilley Hall with prior appointment between Monday and Wednesday only. "],
