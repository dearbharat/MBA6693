MBA 6693 Data Analytics for Business Decisions.

## A.	COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course focuses on developing understanding skills necessary to perform data analytics processes and manage data lifecycle for business decision making. In this course we follow step by step process of data analytics including data extraction, transformation, analyzing and drawing inferences for business decisions. We will use MySQL for data extraction and preprocessing. We will analyze data using R to apply multivariate statistical learning techniques like Clustering, PCA, ARM and Logit models while also familiarising ourselves with version control using Git, interactive JuPyteR notebooks and RStudio Connect. We will also learn advanced algorithms like Random Forest, kNN and SVM using R or similar environment. Prior experience in statistics, optimization, databases and possibly some programming are highly desirable. 

Pre-Requisite(s):	MBA 6606, MBA 6607

## B.	COURSE OBJECTIVES

Data Analytics is a fast becoming a mainstream in business decision making. The objective of this course is to expose students to challenges and tools required in data acquisition from complex databases, apply relevant methods for drawing insights and convert the output into meaningful reports for decision making. The purpose of data analytics will be to provide better consumer, market and operations insights for enhancing business value and automating business decisions. 

## C.	ASSURANCE OF LEARNING

Students will learn the data analytics, inferential thinking and problem-solving skills through 
i.	modeling of various business decision-making situations using advanced methods and
ii.	applying data analytics tools and techniques in to answer complex and challenging problems.

The course also focuses on critical thinking by applying concepts, principles, methods and tools to collect, store, preprocess, model, analyze and visualize data for business decision making. Students will be exposed to collaborative modeling, implementation and analytics workflows in variety of business situations.

The learning goals will be realized in several ways. By the end of this course, students will:
•	Understand importance of Data Analytics in emerging business scenarios.
•	Develop know-how of data pre-processing for data analytics.
•	Translate Business Objectives in mathematical model and apply required techniques.
•	Evaluate and select appropriate tools for solving varied business problems.
•	Identify problems and commission solutions using modern tools and techniques.
•	Design & build a robust a comprehensive data driven decision systems.
•	Strategize competitive advantage for organizations using data analytics approaches to emerging new age business problems.
•	Understand future trends in Data driven decision making.
•	Prepare for further projects and curriculum centered on machine leaning and artificial intelligence

## F.	COURSE UNDERSTANDINGS
1. 	All assignments, midterm exam and final exam are closed book.  No formulas will be provided, only tables. However, each student is allowed to bring an 8.5" x 14" sheet, which may contain formulas deemed necessary by the student. This sheet cannot include solved problems. If a formula sheet is examined and found to contain solved problems, this will be treated as cheating.

2. 	Assignment 1 will cover SQL concepts, Assignment 2 will cover distributed database systems, Assignment 3 will cover Regression and PCA whereas Assignment 4 will cover clustering, LDA and logit models. Case and Group projects will be comprehensive covering all the topics taught in the class.  

## G.	ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
The University of New Brunswick places a high value on academic integrity and has a policy on plagiarism as well as cheating and other academic offences. Plagiarism includes: 

1. Quoting verbatim or almost verbatim from any source, including all electronic sources, without acknowledgement;   

2. Adopting someone else's line of thought, argument, arrangement, or supporting evidence   without acknowledgment;  

3. Submitting someone else's work, in whatever form, without acknowledgment;  

4. Knowingly representing as one's own work any idea of another.    


Examples of other academic offences include: 

1. Cheating on exams, tests, assignments or reports;  

2. Impersonating somebody at a test or exam;   

3. Obtaining an exam, test or other course materials through theft, bribery, collusion,   purchase or other improper manner;   

4. Submitting coursework that is identical or substantially similar to work that has been   submitted for another course;   

5. And, more as set out in the academic regulations of the Undergraduate and   School of Graduate Studies Calendars.   


Penalties for plagiarism and other offences range from a minimum of F (zero) in the assignment,   exam or test to suspension or expulsion from the University, plus a notation of the academic offence   on the student's transcript.
